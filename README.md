# navy
Epitech, first year project. System_unix : game where you can fight against an other terminal (other player). It works with signals. First player will launch the game, the other will lau,ch the game with de PID of the first one. To play you have to enter first the position of a case you want to attack (exemple : A3) the programm will tell you if it's a wrong position or if you touch or if you miss. Then the other player will play..............


==== THE BONUS DIRECTORY ====
I strongly recommand you to launch the game in the bonus direcotry where the game is made in NCURSES. It works the same but it's very nice !!!!!!!!!


To compile : make To compile again and clean ".o" and the binary : make re. To clean all : make fclean.

To use it :

first player : ./navy (file with your map)
second player : ./navy (pid of the other player) (file with your positions)

then the game will launch ! GOOD LUCK HAVE FUN !
