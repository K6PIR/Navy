# navy
Epitech, first year project.

Goal of the project : game where you can fight against an other terminal (an other player). It is a naval battle game ! 
It's coded in C and it works with signals. 

The first player will launch the game, the other will launch the game with de PID of the first one. 
To play you have to enter the position of a case you want to attack (exemple : A3) the programm will tell you if it's a wrong position or if you touch or if you miss. Then the other player will play..............

...........--------> Until you finish, the player who win receive a message and the player who loose too.

==== THE BONUS DIRECTORY ====
I strongly recommand you to launch the game in the bonus direcotry where the game is made in NCURSES. It works the same but it's very nice !!!!!!!!!

To compile : make.

To recompile the project : make re.

To clean all : make fclean.

To use it :

first player : ./navy (file with your map)
second player : ./navy (pid of the other player) (file with your positions)

DON'T FORGET TO LAUNCH IT IN THE BONUS DIRECTORY, IT'S SO NICE !!!

then the game will launch ! GOOD LUCK HAVE FUN !
